## Methodology

1. Why I did this project? I started this class on machine learning and wanted to get some practice using sci-kit learn and apply some of the concepts I learned and try some supervised training data concepts.

2. I wrote a Python program that uses a dataset from the machine learning repository from 2020 [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php] that takes a name as input and predicts if the name is mostly assigned to female or male at birth.

3. I created a small API written in Python with Flask and hosted on https://www.pythonanywhere.com that would take a name as an input using HTTP POST and return the JSON result described above.

4. I then wrote the HTML page you are seeing here with some JavaScript and CSS to tie everything together.

Everything from scratch to this result took about 7 hours of work, and here is the list of the tools I used to get this up as quickly as possible:

- OpenAI to generate texts and puns [https://chat.openai.com/]
- The SVG resources found on IconFinder (free to use)
- The color palette using Adobe Kuler [https://color.adobe.com/]
- The SVG Animated Loader by Nikhil Krishnan [https://codepen.io/nikhil8krishnan]
- Bulma CSS framework [https://bulma.io/]
- Sci Kit learn [https://scikit-learn.org/]
